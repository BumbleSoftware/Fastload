# Fastload

Fastload, is a simple mod that reduces world loading time. This serves as an alternative to ksyxis, which uses an unsafe method of cutting down time.

Credits for mods that are integrated:
- Ksyxis by VidTu (Incompatible)
- Forcecloseloadingscreen by kennytv (Incompatible)
- ...Respect to them for the ideas!

How is it done?
The 441 loading engine is a chunk pre-generator for your worlds. This is very inefficient and wastes a lot of time.

Here are its features:
- Reducing 21^2 chunks to 5^2
- Permitting the rendering engine to run in the background whilst the world is still loading
- Cancels 'Loading Terrain' for even quicker loading times.
- Adjusts the visual chunk loading to be smaller and in sync with the smaller radius.

Speed times: [All other elements are controlled!]
